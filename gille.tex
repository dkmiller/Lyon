\section*{Introduction}

Everything to be discussed is classical, in the sense that it can (probably) be 
found in \cite{dg80} or \cite{milneAGS}. 

The classical theory of affine algebraic groups over $\dC$ treats such groups 
as (Zariski-closed) subgroups of various $\generallinear_n(\dC)$. This theory 
is closely connected to that of compact Lie groups. For example, the torus 
$\dG_\mult=\generallinear_1=\spectrum(\dC[t^{\pm 1}])$ corresponds to the 
one-dimensional real torus $S^1$. Everything can be treated as varieties over 
$\dC$. 

Let $k$ be an arbitrary field, e.g.\ $\dF_q$, $\dF_q(t)$, $\dR$, \ldots. The 
natural approach to algebraic groups over $k$ is a ``schematic'' one, i.e.\ 
using schemes. For fields of positive characteristics, there are some recent 
improvements to the theory of algebraic groups over $k$. On the one hand, there 
is theory of \cite{cgp10} on so-called pseudo-reductive groups, and 
for commutative groups, there is recent work of Brion and Titano(sp?). 

New phenomenon occur even over $k=\overline{\dF_p}$. For example, 
$\generallinear_2$ is no longer ``linearly reductive.'' In other words, its 
category of representations is \emph{not} semisimple. Also, there are 
``extensions'' of $\dG_\additive=\spectrum(k[t])$ by itself which are not 
split (coming from Witt vectors). For example, one could put 
$(x_0,x_1)+(y_0,y_1) = (x_0+y_0, x_1+y_1-S_1(x_0,y_0))$, where 
\[
  S_1(x,y) = \frac{(x+y)^p - x^p-y^p}{p} \in \dZ[x,y] .
\]
This is the group $W_2$ of ``additive Witt vectors of length two.'' It fits 
into an exact sequence $0 \to \dG_\additive \to W_2 \to \dG_\additive \to 0$ 
which is not split. Indeed, evaluated at $\dF_p$, the sequence is 
$0 \to \dZ/p \to \dZ/p^2 \to \dZ/p \to 0$. 

Also, in positive characteristic, the intersection of (smooth) groups is not 
necessarily smooth! For example, let $G_1=\{x^p+x=y\}$ and 
$G_2=\{x=y\}$ as subgroups of $\dG_\additive^2$. The intersection 
$G_1\times_{\dG_\additive^2} G_2 = \{x^p=0, x=y\}$, which is not even reduced. 

Over non-perfect fields of characteristic $p$ (for example function fields or 
local fields) things can be even worse. The following example over 
$k=\dF_p(t)$ is due to Tits. Let 
$G=\{x+t x^p+y^p=0\}\subset (\dG_{\additive,k})^2$. One can check that $G$ is 
smooth and connected. However, if $p\geqslant 3$, then 
$G(k)=\{(0,0)\}$. In contrast, over an infinite perfect field $F$, the set 
$G(F)$ is Zariski dense in $G$ for all affine connected $G$. To see that 
$G$ is smooth, base-change to $k(\sqrt[p] t)=\dF_p(t')$. In that field, 
\[
  x+t x^p+y^p = x+(t'x)^p + y^p = x+(t'x+y)^p ,
\]
so $\dG_{k(\sqrt[p] t)}\simeq \dG_{\additive,k(\sqrt[p] t)}$. Now we show 
that $G(k)=1$. If there is $(x,y)\in G(k)$ with $x=0$, then one easily sees 
that $y=0$. Suppose $x(t)=\frac{P(t)}{Q(t)}$. We can assume $P$ and $Q$ are 
relatively prime. Some simple algebra gives $P' Q-P Q' + P^p Q^{2-P} = 0$, 
which cannot be. 





\section{Generalities}

The theory over positive characteristic is already complicated enough to make 
it no additional effort to work over an arbitrary commutative ring. For 
example, if $k'/k$ is a purely inseparable extension of the form 
$k(\sqrt[p] a)$, then $k'\otimes_k k' = k'[t]/(t-\sqrt[p] a)^p$ is not even 
a product of fields. But it is an Artinian local ring. One could restrict to 
this (as is done in \cite[VIa]{sga3}). 

For the rest of this section, fix a (commutative, unital) ring $R$. An 
\emph{$R$-functor} is a covariant functor 
$F:R\algebras\to \mathsf{Set}$. If $X$ is an affine scheme over $R$, we write 
$R[X]=\Gamma(X)$; note that $X=\spectrum(R[X])$. Let 
$h_X(S)=X(S)=\hom_{R\algebras}(R[X],S)$. We say that an $R$-functor $F$ is 
\emph{representable} by an affine scheme $X$ over $R$ if there is an 
equivalence $h_X \isomorphism F$. The Yoneda Lemma tells us that such an $X$ is 
unique up to unique isomorphism. Even better, 

\begin{lemma}[Yoneda]
The map $\hom_{R\text{-}\mathsf{Fun}}(h_X,F) \to F(X)$ that sends 
$\eta$ to $\eta_X(1_X)$ is a bijection. 
\end{lemma}

In light of this, we will usually define group schemes via their functor of 
points. It makes sense to speak of ``group-valued $R$-functors,'' and we can 
define an \emph{affine group scheme over $R$} to be an affine scheme $X$, 
together with the structure of a group-valued functor on $h_X$. In other words, 
for each $S$, we have a ``multiplication'' $X(S)\times X(S) \to X(S)$, 
``inverse'' $X(S) \to X(S)$, and ``identity'' $1\in X(S)$. These are required 
to be compatible with maps $S\to S'$ in the obvious way. To give $X$ the 
structure of a group scheme is equivalent to giving $R[X]$ the structure of a 
Hopf algebra. 

\begin{example}[constant groups]
Let $\Gamma$ be a finite (abstract) group. Let 
$G=\coprod_{\sigma\in \Gamma}\spectrum R$, with multiplication induced by 
$\Gamma$. People sometimes write $G=\Gamma_R$, or $G=\underline\Gamma_R$. The 
same definition works if $\Gamma$ is not finite, but $\underline\Gamma$ will no 
longer be affine. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}[vector groups]
For $N$ an $R$-module, define $\dV(N)(S)=\hom_S(N\otimes_R S,S)$. This is 
clearly a $R$-group functor, represented by 
$\spectrum(\symmetric_R(N^\vee))$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
If $M$ is an $R$-module, we put $\dW(M)(S)=M\otimes_R S$. This is not always 
representable. If $R$ is noetherian, $\dW(M)$ is representable if and only if 
$M$ is locally free. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}[linear groups]
Let $A$ be an (associative) $R$-algebra. We define 
$\generallinear_1(A)(S) = (A\otimes_R S)^\times$. This functor is not always 
representable. However, if $A$ is finitely-generated, locally free (as an 
$R$-module), then $\generallinear_1(A)$ is representable. Sometimes we will 
just write $A^\times$ for $\generallinear_1(A)$ (especially if $A$ is a 
division ring over a field). 
\end{example}

\begin{example}[diagonalizable groups]
Let $M$ be an (abstract) commutative group. Let $R[M]$ be the corresponding 
group ring. This is naturally a Hopf algebra via 
$\Delta(m)=m\otimes m$. Put
$\diagonal_R(M)=\spectrum(R[M])$. For example, if $M=\dZ$, then 
$R[M]=R[t^{\pm 1}]$, so $\diagonal_R(M)=\dG_{\mult, R}$. If 
$M=\dZ/n$, then $R[M]=R[t]/(t^n-1)$, so 
$\diagonal_R(M)=\mu_{n,R}$. A homomorphism 
$f:M_1 \to M_2$ induces $f_\ast:R[M_1] \to R[M_2]$, hence 
$f^\ast:\diagonal_R(M_2) \to \diagonal_R(M_1)$. 
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
The functor 
$\diagonal_R:\mathsf{Ab}^\circ \to \{\text{diagonalisable groups over }R\}$ is 
an equivalence of categories. [See SGA 3, exp.8]
\end{exercise}

If $D$ is a group scheme, put $\widehat D=\hom(D,\dG_\mult)$; this is the group 
of \emph{characters} of $D$. 

\begin{exercise}
Show that $\hom(\diagonal(M), \dG_{\additive,R}) = 0$ for all $M$. 
\end{exercise}

If $R=k$ is a field, then any closed subgroup $G\subset \diagonal(M)$ is of 
the form $\diagonal_k(M/M')$ for some $M'\subset M$. In other words, over a 
field, subgroups (and qotients, in fact) of diagonalisable groups are 
diagonalisable. 





\section{Basic facts on affine groups over \texorpdfstring{$k$}{k}}

Throughout, let $k$ be a field. 

\begin{definition}
An \emph{affine algebraic group over $k$} is a group scheme $G$ over $k$, such 
that $G$ is affine of finite type. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An affine algebraic group over $k$ is \emph{linear} if it is also smooth. 
\end{definition}

It is a non-trivial fact that if $G$ is an affine group over $k$, then there is 
a closed embedding $G\hookrightarrow \generallinear_n$. There is a paper by 
[Godeles, Popov, 2003]. Supposing $k$ is infinite and $G$ is smooth, there 
exists $G\hookrightarrow \generallinear(V)$ and 
$f\in V^\vee\otimes_k V^\vee\otimes_k V$, such that 
$G=\{g\in \generallinear(V):g^\vee\circ f = f\}$. Moreover, there exists a 
(possibly non-associative, non-unital) $k$-algebra $A$ such that 
$G=\automorphism(A)\subset \generallinear_k(A)$. (The two statements are the 
clearly equivalent.) 

If $G$ an affine algebraic group over $k$, then the associated reduced scheme 
$G_\reduced$ is not necessarily a $k$-group. Essentially, the problem is that 
$(-)_\reduced$ does not commute with products. If $k$ is perfect, then 
$G_\reduced\times_k G_\reduced$, and $G_\reduced\subset G$ is a closed 
$k$-subgroup of $G$. 

\begin{example}
Let $G=\mu_3\rtimes \dZ/2$ over $\dF_3$, the action being via inversion. Then 
$G_\reduced=\dZ/2$ is not a normal subgroup. 
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
Let $G$ be an affine $k$-group. Then the following are equivalent: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $G$ is smooth 
  \item $G$ is geometrically reduced 
  \item $\sO_{G,e}\otimes \bar k$ is reduced 
  \item $G$ admits a nonempty smooth open $U\subset G$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The only nontrivial part is 4$\Rightarrow$1g. But one can base-change to 
$\bar k$, and note that $G_{\bar k}=\bigcup_{g\in G(\bar k)} g U_{\bar k}$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
Let $G$ be an affine $k$-group. Let $\{f_i:V\to G\}$ be morphisms from 
geometrically reduced affine $k$-schemes. Then there is a unique smallest 
closed $k$-subgroup, written $\Gamma_G(\{f_i\})$, such that the $f_i$ 
factor through $\Gamma_G(\{f_i\})$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
First we suppose we have a single $f:H\to G$, where $H$ is a smooth group. 
Then the schematic image $\image(f)\subset G$ works. 

Next, we suppose that $G$ admits a maximal smooth $k$-subgroup $G^\dag$. (If 
$k$ is perfect, then $G^\dag=G_\reduced$.) 
\end{proof}

If $f:G\times G\to G$ is 
$(g,h)\mapsto [g,h]$, then $\Gamma_G(f) = \sD G$, the derived subgroup of 
$G$. 


\subsection{Maximal smooth subgroups}

Let $k$ be a field, $A$ a $k$-algebra. Recall we say that $A$ is 
\emph{geometrically reduced} (Bourbaki says \emph{separable}) if 
$A\otimes_k K$ is reduced for all extensions $K/k$. If $A$ is of finite 
type, one only needs $A\otimes_k \bar k$ to be reduced. 

If $A$ is of finite type and geometrically reduced, then for $X=\spectrum A$, 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $X$ is generically smooth over $k$ (i.e.\ there exists an 
    affine dense open smooth subscheme of $X$ over $k$)
  \item $X(k^s)$ is dense in $X$ 
\end{enumerate}

Now, as before, if $G$ is an affine algebraic $k$-group, then it admits a 
maximal smooth $k$-subgroup $G^\dagger$. This subgroup enjoys the following 
properties: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $G$ is connected, so is $G^\dagger$. 
  \item $G^\dagger$ is the largest geometrically reduced closed $k$-subscheme of $G$. 
  \item $G^\dagger(k) = G(k)$. 
  \item If $k$ is separably closed, $G^\dagger$ is the schematic closure of 
    $G(k^s)$ in $G$. 
  \item If $k$ is perfect, then $G^\dagger = G_\reduced$. 
  \item If $K/k$ is a separable field extension, then 
    $(G^\dagger)\times_k K \isomorphism (G_K)^\dagger$. 
\end{enumerate}

We will discuss 2 and 3 in greater depth. For 2, suppose 
$i:X\hookrightarrow G$ and $X$ is affine and geometrically reduced. We can 
attach to this data a smooth group $\Gamma_G(i)\subset G$. But 
$\Gamma_G(i)\subset G^\dagger$, so $X\subset G^\dagger$. 

Regarding 3: the inclusion $G^\dagger(k)\subset G(k)$ is obvious. Let 
$g\in G(k)$. Then $X=g G^\dagger\subset G$ is also smooth, whence 
$g G^\dagger\subset G^\dagger$, which yields $g\in G(k)$. 

\begin{example}
Here we show that $(-)^\dagger$ does not necessarily commute with inseparable 
base-change. Let $k=\dF_p(t)$, $G=\{x^p+t y^p=0\}\subset (\dG_{\additive,k})^2$. 
We claim that $G^\dagger=0$, but $(G_{k'})^\dagger = \dG_{\additive, k'}$ (hence 
$(G_{k'})^\dagger \ne 0$) if $k'=k(\sqrt[p] t)$. 
First we show that $G^\dagger=0$. It suffices to show that $G(k^s)=0$. Let 
$(x,y)\in G(k^s)$ be nonzero. But $x^p+t y^p=0$ tells us that $t$ is a 
$p$-power in $k^s$, a contradiction. Over $k'$, the equation defining $G$ 
is $(x+t' y)^p=0$, which clearly has maximal smooth subscheme
$\{x+t' y=0\} \simeq \dG_{\additive,k'}$. 
\end{example}


\begin{proposition}
Let $f:H\to G$ be a homomorphism of affine algebraic $k$-groups. Assume that 
$G$ is reduced. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $f$ is faithfully flat
  \item $f$ is surjective on $\bar k$-points
  \item $f$ is dominant 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

Recall that a ring homomorphism $f:A\to B$ is \emph{flat} (or that $B$ is flat 
over $A$) if the tensor-product functor $-\otimes_A B$ is exact. We say that $B$ 
is \emph{faithfully flat} if it is flat over $A$, and moreover the map 
$\spectrum B \to \spectrum A$ is surjective. 

\begin{proposition}
Let $f:H\to G$ be a homomorphism of algebraic $k$-groups. Then the following are 
equivalent: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $f$ is a closed immersion
  \item $f$ is an immersion 
  \item $f$ is a monomorphism (i.e.\ for all $A\in k\algebras$, the map 
    $f_\ast:H(A) \to G(A)$ is injective)
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

This fails over rings that are not fields (e.g.\ the ring $\dZ_2$ of $2$-adic 
integers). One might ask whether injectivity on $\bar k$-points suffices. The 
answer is no. Let $F:\dG_\additive \to \dG_\additive$ be Frobenius over a field 
of characteristic $p$. It is not an immersion, but is injective on 
$\bar k$-valued points. If we take $\dF_p[t]/(t^p)$-valued points, then 
Frobenius is no longer injective. One puts 
$\boldsymbol\alpha_p = \spectrum(\dF_p[t]/t^p)$. 





\section{Using group functors}

Throughout, let $R$ be our base ring. We are given three $R$-group functors 
$G_1$, $G_2$, $G_3$, and maps 
$\alpha:G_1 \to G_2$, $\beta:G_2 \to G_3$. We say that the sequence of $R$-group 
functors 
\[
  1 \to G_1 \to G_2 \to G_3 \to 1 
\]
is \emph{exact} if for all $S\in R\algebras$, the sequence 
\[
  1 \to G_1(S) \to G_2(S) \to G_3(S) \to 1 
\]
is exact as a sequence of abstract groups. 

Let $f:G\to H$ be a morphism of $R$-group functors. We define an $R$-group 
functor $\ker(f)$ by $\ker(f)(S)=\ker(G(S) \to H(S))$. There is an exact sequence 
\[
  1 \to \ker(f) \to G \to H .
\]
If $G$ and $H$ are (representable by) affine algebraic groups, so is $\ker(f)$. 

\begin{example}[Witt vectors]
Over $\dF_p$, we have seen that there is an exact sequence 
$0 \to \dG_\additive \to W_2 \to \dG_\additive \to 0$. In fact, this sequence 
splits on the right. 
\end{example}

Note that if $1 \to G_1 \to G_2 \xrightarrow f G_3 \to 1$ is an exact 
sequence of affine algebraic groups, then $f:G_2 \to G_3$ admits a section. 
To see this, just look at the surjection 
$G_2(R[G_3]) \twoheadrightarrow G_3(R[G_2])$. 


\subsection{Semidirect products of group schemes}

Suppose $G$ and $H$ are affine $R$-group schemes, and 
$\theta:G\to \automorphism(H)$ is a morphism of $R$-group functors. Here, 
$\automorphism(H)$ is defined by 
\[
  \automorphism(H)(S) = \automorphism_{S\textnormal{-}\mathsf{gp}}(H_S) .
\]
So for each $S$, we have a homomorphism 
$\theta_S:G(S) \to \automorphism(H_S)$. We can define the semidirect product 
(on the scheme $H\times G$) by 
$(h_1,g_1) \cdot (h_2,g_2) = (h_1 \theta(g) h_2, g_1 g_2)$ as usual. This 
gives us a group scheme $H\rtimes^\theta G$ that fits into an exact sequence of 
$R$-functors:
\[
  1 \to H \to H\rtimes^\theta G \to G \to 1 .
\]
For example, we earlier saw the scheme $\boldsymbol\mu_n\rtimes \dZ/2$. Also, 
one can form $\dG_\additive^n\rtimes \generallinear_n$. 

Let $A$ be a commutative affine $R$-group scheme, and $G$ an $R$-group scheme 
with an action on $A$ via $\theta:G\to \automorphism(A)$. We wish to classify 
$R$-group extensions of $G$ by $A$ with respect to this action. It turns out 
that there is a group $\h^2(G,A)$ (second Hochschild cohomology) which does this. 

Let's look at the special case where $A=\dV(N)$ for $N$ an $R$-module. 

\begin{theorem}[Grothendieck]
If $G=\diagonal_R(M)$ acts on $\dV(N)$, then $\h_0^i(G,\dV(N))=0$ for all 
$i>0$. In particular, extensions of$G$ by $\dV(N)$ are split. 
\end{theorem}


\subsection{Actions, centralizers, etc.}

Let $G$ be an affine $R$-group scheme, $X$ an affine $R$-scheme. An 
\emph{action} of $G$ on $X$ is a homomorphism 
$\theta:G\to \automorphism(X)$, where $\automorphism(X)$ is the $R$-group 
functor defined by 
\[
  \automorphism(X)(S) = \automorphism_{S\textnormal{-}\mathsf{Sch}}(X_S) .
\]
In other words, for each $S$, we have a homomorphism 
$\theta_S:G(S) \to \automorphism_{S\textnormal{-}\mathsf{Sch}}(X_S)$. 

\emph{Warning}: the functor $\automorphism(X)$ is very rarely representable. 
In characteristic zero, $\automorphism(\dG_\additive)$ is represented by 
$\dG_\mult$, i.e.\ for all $\dQ$-algebras $S$, the natural map 
$S^\times \to \automorphism_{S\textnormal{-}\mathsf{gp}}(\dG_{\additive,S})$ is 
an isomorphism. But in characteristic $p>0$, 
$\automorphism_{S\textnormal{-}\mathsf{gp}}(\dG_{a,S})$ consists of 
non-commutative polynomials $a_0+a_1 t^p + \cdots + a_r t^{p^r}$, with 
$a_0\in S^\times$ and the $a_i$ nilpotent. 

Let $G$ act on $X$, and let $X_1,X_2\subset X$ be closed $R$-subschemes. We 
define various functors: 
\begin{align*}\tag{transporter}
  \transporter_G(X_1,X_2)(S) &= \{g\in G(S):\theta(g)X_1(S')\subset X_2(S')\text{ for all }S'/S\} \\  \tag{strict transporter}
  \stricttransporter_G(X_1,X_2)(S) &= \{g\in G(S):\theta(g)\text{ induces }X_{1,S}\isomorphism X_{2,S}\} \\ \tag{normalizer}
  \normalizer_G(X_1) &= \transporter_G(X_1,X_1) \\ \tag{centralizer} 
  \centralizer_G(X_1) &= \{g\in G(S):\theta(g) = 1\text{ on }X_{1,S}\} .
\end{align*}

\begin{theorem}[Grothendieck]
Let $R=k$ be a field, $X$ an affine scheme, $G$ an affine algebraic $k$-group 
acting on $X$, and $X_1,X_2\subset X$ closed $k$-subschemes. Then all the above 
functors are representable by closed $k$-subschemes of $G$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
Consider the action of $G$ on itself by inner automorphisms. We see that if 
$H\subset G$ is a $k$-subgroup, then 
$\normalizer_G(H)$ and $\centralizer_G(H)$ exist as subgroup schemes of $G$. 
\end{example}

The functors we have defined are the \emph{schematic} transporter, normalizer, 
\ldots. These can be different from the classical objects of the same name. 

Let $G$ be a reductive group, $P\subset G$ a parabolic subgroup, and 
$U\subset P$ its unipotent radical. Classically, one says that 
$P=N_G(U)$. This is true in the language of reduced varieties. 

\begin{example}
Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $2$ ($\overline{\dF_2}$ for example). 
Let $G=\projectivegenerallinear(2)_k$, $B\subset G$ the standard Borel, and 
$U\subset B$ the unipotent radical. We claim that 
$B\subsetneq N_G(U)$. Indeed, writing $\smat a b c d$ for projective 
coordinates of $G$, we have $B=\{c=0\}$. But $J=\{c^2=0\}$ is an 
$R$-subgroup of $G$ strictly containing $B$, but $J\subset N_G(U)$. Indeed, 
if $x^2=0$, then 
\[
  \smat{1}{}{x}{1} \smat{1}{b}{}{1} \smat{1}{}{x}{1} = \smat{1+b x}{b}{}{1+b x} = \smat{1}{b(1+x)}{}{1} 
\]
within $\projectivegenerallinear(2)$. 
\end{example}


\subsection{Weil restriction}

Recall the extension $\dC/\dR$ given by adding a root of $z^2=2+i$. 
Writing $(x+i y)^2 = 2+i$, we get two equations with coefficients in $\dR$. 
This corresponds to Weil restriction. 

Let $R\to S$ be a ring extension. Let $F$ be an $S$-functor. Following 
Grothendieck (Weil writes $\operatorname{R}_{S/R}$) we define an $R$-functor 
$\Pi_{S/R} F$ by 
\[
  (\Pi_{S/R} F)(R') = F(R'\otimes_R S) .
\]
If $F$ is representable, it is natural ask under what conditions the 
restriction of scalars $\Pi_{S/R} F$ is representable. 

\begin{theorem}
Assume $R\to S$ is finite and locally free. Let $Y$ be an affine $S$-scheme. 
Then $\Pi_{S/R} Y$ is representable by an affine $R$-scheme. Moreoveer, if 
$Y$ is of finite presentation, so is $\prod_{S/R} Y$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}[vector groups]
If $N$ is an $S$-module, then recall $\dV(N)(T) = \hom(N\otimes_S T,T)$. Let 
$M$ be the ``scalar restriction'' of $N$ to $R$ (i.e.\ $N$ considered as an 
$R$-module). Then $\Pi_{S/R} \dV(N) = \dV(M)$. 
\end{example}

If $S=\overbrace{R\times \cdots \times R}^d$, then an $S$-scheme $Y$ is just a 
$d$-tuple of $R$-schemes $Y_1,\dots,Y_d$. One has 
$\Pi_{S/R} Y = Y_1\times_R \times \cdots \times_R Y_d$. 

Weil restriction does not transform open covers into open covers! Consider 
$G=\dG_{\additive, \dC\times \dC}$. Then 
$\Pi_{\dC\times \dC/\dC} G = \dG_\additive \times \dG_\additive$. If 
$U_0=\{t\ne 0\}$ and $U_1=\{t\ne 1\}$, then 
$\{\Pi U_0,\Pi U_1\}$ is \emph{not} an open cover of $\dG_\additive^2$.
